# Deloitte Consulting for Daikibo Factories


## Daikibo Factories Performance Report

Overview:
This report looks at how Daikibo factories are doing. It shows problems with machines stopping and how long they are stopped. The goal is to find ways to make things work better.

## Key Numbers:

*  Total machines: 36

*  Machines not working now: 8

*  Total time machines were stopped: 1030 minutes

<br>


## Detailed Look:

1- Stopped Time by Country:

* Japan: 590 minutes (most of the stopped time).

* China: 420 minutes.

* Germany: 20 minutes (very little stopped time).


<br>


2- Stopped Time by Factory:

* Daikibo Seiko (Japan): 480 minutes.

* Daikibo Shenzhen (China): 420 minutes.

* Daikibo Meiyo (Japan): 110 minutes.

* Daikibo Berlin (Germany): 20 minutes.


<br>


3- Stopped Time by Machine Type:

* LaserWelder: 480 minutes (most stopped time).

* LaserCutter: 430 minutes.

* HeavyDutyDrill: 70 minutes.

* Furnace: 20 minutes.

* CNC, ConveyorBelt, SpotWelder: 10 minutes each.

* AirWrench, MetalPress: 0 minutes (never stopped).


<br>


## Simple Suggestions:

1- Focus on Japan and China: Since Japan and China have the most stopped time, we need to check why things are stopping there (especially in the Seiko and Shenzhen factories).

* Suggestion: Create small teams to look closely at why machines stop in the Seiko and Shenzhen factories.

<br>


2- Take Care of Laser Machines (LaserWelder & LaserCutter): Because LaserWelder and LaserCutter machines stop the most, they need extra attention.

* Suggestion:

  *  Have a plan to check and fix these machines regularly to prevent them from stopping.

  *  Think about training more people to fix these laser machines.

  *  See if the old laser machines need to be replaced.

  *  Find out if there are common mistakes or operation issues that cause these machines to stop.

<br>

3-Share Ideas:
*  Suggestion: Let the factories that are doing well (like the one in Berlin) share their good ways of working with the factories that are having more problems.

By following these simple suggestions, Daikibo factories can have less machine downtime, which will help them work better, save money, and make more products.
